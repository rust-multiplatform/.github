# Rust Multiplatform

This GitHub Organization is aiming to create examples for cross/multi-platform Rust applications.

## Platform projects

Platform projects showcase what is needed to get Rust code running on a given platform.  
On some platforms an asset folder or a specific Rust entrypoint is required.
